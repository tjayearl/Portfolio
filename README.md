# Tjay Earl — Portfolio System

> **Theme:** Modern Medieval / Illuminated Chronicle  
> **Goal:** Signal product thinking, taste, and narrative clarity  
> **Primary Message:** “I design outcomes, not just interfaces.”

## 📖 Project Overview

This portfolio is constructed to demonstrate a transition from frontend development to product management. It avoids standard portfolio tropes in favor of a narrative-driven approach ("The Manuscript") that highlights decision-making, constraints, and outcomes.

The aesthetic is "Modern Medieval"—clean parchment, thin dividers, and typography that evokes an illuminated chronicle, signaling that the work is crafted with intent and history.

## ⚖️ Global Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness
The theme must never block understanding.
- **Readability:** Text readable within 3 seconds.
- **Navigation:** Obvious without explanation.
- **Motion:** Animations are subtle and purposeful (like pages turning).

### 2. Product Thinking First
Every section answers:
- *Why does this exist?*
- *Who is it for?*
- *What decision was made?*
- *What changed because of it?*

### 3. Restraint = Maturity
- No loud effects or over-animation.
- No fantasy clichés; if it feels like a game UI, it is dialed back.

## 🗺️ System Sections

### 1. Entry Experience (The Prologue)
Sets the tone and identity immediately.
- **Content:** "Product-minded. System-driven."
- **Behavior:** Loads instantly, transitions automatically to the homepage.

### 2. Homepage (The Manuscript)
Answers "Who is this?" and "Why should I care?" in under 10 seconds.
- **Headline:** "I turn unclear problems into structured products."
- **Subtext:** Aspiring Product Manager focused on users, systems, and outcomes.

### 3. About (The Chronicler)
Humanizes the author without rambling.

### 4. Projects (The Campaigns)

2.  **Constraints:** Time, skills, tools, scope.
3.  **Role:** What was actually owned.
4.  **Key Decisions:** Why choices were made.
5.  **Outcome / Learnings:** Honest reflection on results.
